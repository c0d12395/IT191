###Immediately After Graduating

For my three immediately after graduating jobs I specifically looked for jobs at Country Financial and State Farm. I have a mentor at Country Financial that I have met a few times and emailed quite a few times. Through him I also met another employee at Country Financial that is a recent Illinois State University graduate. Keeping in contact with both of them will greatly help me with finding out how to get a job after graduating. I will ask them about what they did after graduating to get their jobs. I am also working on improving my resume with my mentor. After I finish working on my resume with him I will continue to add more information to it as I take more classes and learn new technologies. I will also get more people to review my resume. I looked at State Farm because I have participated in a capture the flag and mobile application development contests they sponsored. I will try to get in contact with some people at these contests in the future. It would be good to get advice from people from State Farm as well as Country Financial to compare the companies. This summer I am going to look for an internship. Getting an internship would vastly improve my qualifications. On top of the internship itself being impressive just doing the internship would give me lots of experience in the technologies actually used in the workplace as well as workplace culture and connections.

For my three five to eight years after graduation jobs I was more general because I am unsure where exactly I might want to go that far in the future. After I graduate I want to find which career I really enjoy doing. That may not be the first job I take. For example my mentor switched from networking to security at Country Financial. Then once I find what I actually enjoy I will work very hard to improve in that field and move up into higher paying positions. For example right now I am starting to become interested in web development. I already know HTML and CSS a little bit. Now in the near future I want to try to teach myself more about HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript.
